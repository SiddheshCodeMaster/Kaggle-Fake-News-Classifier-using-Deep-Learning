# Kaggle-Fake-News-Classifier-using-Deep-Learning
Applying different Deep Learning technique - LSTM to classify fake news. 

Data set taken from Kaggle.

**Applied vigorous training and testing of the LSTM Model.**

**Achieved 90.63 % accuracy**

Applied **Keras RandomSearch Tuner** to reduce the overfitting by providing the best parameters selected by the **RandomSearch Algorithm**.

Applied Sequentially built MLP to make a comparison between traditional and modern deep learning methods.
